          <pre>
[CALYPSO:]
Someone arrived today
They said they're taking you away
That you're not mine to save
And soon I won't get to see your face
So I came by to say
You're unlike anyone I have ever known
Cause you're all I've ever known

And if I pushed you
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I ambushed you
For that, I'll say I was wrong
And if you hate me
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you

[CALYPSO (ENSEMBLE):]
But I'm not sorry for loving you
(I'm not sorry for loving you)
I'm not sorry for loving you
(I'm not sorry for loving you)

[ODYSSEUS:]
Calypso

[CALYPSO:]
Let me speak
I spent my whole life here
Was cast away when I was young
Alone for a hundred years
I had no friends but the sky and sun
So when you washed ashore
I thought for sure that you were my dream come true
I thought I knew

So if I pushed you
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I ambushed you
For that, I'll say I was wrong
And if you hate me
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you

[CALYPSO (ENSEMBLE):]
But I'm not sorry for loving you
(I'm not sorry for loving you)
I'm not sorry for loving you
(I'm not sorry for loving you)

[CALYPSO:]
I'm not sorry
I'm angry and tired and restless and sad
I'm stuck in the moments I swore that we had
I wish you would chase me
Or try to embrace me
For once, I wish you would lie and say

[ODYSSEUS:]
I love you

[CALYPSO:]
You do?

[ODYSSEUS:]
But not in the way that you want me to

[CALYPSO (ENSEMBLE):]
I hate that I fell in love with you
(Hate that I fell in love with you)
Why did I fall in love with you?
(Why did I fall in love with you?)
What do I do with this love for you?
(What do I do with this love for you?)
How am I supposed to get over you?
(How am I supposed to get over you?)
Why in the world won't you love me too?
