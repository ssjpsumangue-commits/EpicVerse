[POLITES]
You can relax, my friend

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Huh?

[POLITES]
I can tell you're getting nervous
So do yourself a service
And try to relax, my friend

[ODYSSEUS]
I'm fine, Polites

[POLITES]
Think of all that we have been through
We'll survive what we get into

I know that you're tired of the war and bloodshed
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to live?
Look at how you grip your sword, enough said
Why should we take when we could give?
You can show a person that you trust them
When you stop and lower your guard
Here we havе a chance for some adjustment
Givе it a try, it's not that hard
I'm telling you

This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

[LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
Welcome

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Stay back

[LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
Stay back

[POLITES]
My friend, greet the world with open arms

[ODYSSEUS]
We're only here for food

[LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
Food

[ODYSSEUS]
Six hundred friends are waiting for us to show our faces


[LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
Food

[ODYSSEUS]
Stay back, I'm warning you

[LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
Food (Num num num)

[ODYSSEUS]
If we don't get back safely
My men will turn this place into blazes

[LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
Here you go

[POLITES]
See? This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

[ODYSSEUS]
My friend, I wish that I could say that I agree
But look at the way this fruit is glowing
And filled with glowing seeds
It took me a while to notice just what kind of fruit they eat
It's a lotus, it controls your mind and never lets you free
That's what we'd get with open arms


[POLITES]
Lotus eaters, I'd like to show my friend that kindness is brave
Could you tell me where there's other food to eat?

[LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
The cave (Scary cave)

[POLITES]
A cave! You're saying there's a cave where we could feast?
And where do we sail to find this food-filled cave?

[LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
East (That way)

[POLITES, spoken]
Thank you

[LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
Welcome

[POLITES]
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
I see in your face, there is so much guilt inside your heart
So why not replace it and light up the world?
Here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

[ODYSSEUS]
Greet the world with open arms

[POLITES]
You can relax, my friend
