          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <pre>
[ENSEMBLE, SIRENS]
Penelope (Ah, oh)
Penelope (Ah, oh)

[PENELOPE]
Don’t you miss me?

[ODYSSEUS]
More than you know

[PENELOPE]
Then jump in the water and kiss me

[ODYSSEUS]
Penelope, I’ve told you this before
You know I’m afraid of the water

[PENELOPE]
I’ll make sure that you are safe and sound
Come play with me and our daughter and let’s watch our love leave the ground

[ODYSSEUS]
Oh, I would
But I’d be suffering trying to float the whole time

[PENELOPE]
I would take the suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]
Oh, as good as it sounds, right here I’m just fin?

[PENELOPE]
I could take the suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]
You know that I pr?fer my feet on the ground

[PENELOPE]
I will take the suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]
Fine, but only if you answer a question or two

[PENELOPE]
Of course!

[ODYSSEUS]
Okay, so let’s say I was on the run or hiding…
From I don’t know Poseidon…
And let’s say he blocked the way home with giant waves and giant storms

[PENELOPE]
Oh no!
[ODYSSEUS]
How am I to evade him?
How am I to get home?
Which route should I take?
Where am I supposed to go?

[PENELOPE]
He will chase you high and low
So find a place he’d never go
The one way you'll get home
Is sailing where he's scared to roam, oh
It’s through the lair of Scylla

[ODYSSEUS]
No...

[PENELOPE]
This is your only way home
The lair of Scylla

[ODYSSEUS]
But Scylla has a cost

[PENELOPE]
Well, you asked and now you know
Now jump in the water!

[ODYSSEUS]
Penelope, why?
You know I’m too shy and terrified

[PENELOPE]
I would take the suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]
Oh, for you, I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?

[PENELOPE]
I could take the suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]
You should come onto the ship
We'll jump at the same time

[PENELOPE]
I will take the suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]
Ah, the things I do for you
