          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <pre>
[ODYSSEUS:]
Great wind god, Aeolus
I don't know if you know this
But our path to home is blocked by an impenetrable storm
I ask for your assistance
So we at last can go the distance
Can you cast the perfect winds for us and aid our journey home?

[AEOLUS:]
Ha ha ha
I am the wind, twisting and turning
I give the fire enough to stay burning
Let's play a game

[ODYSSEUS:]
A game?

[AEOLUS:]
That's what I'm serving
And if you win, you will get what you're yearning

[ODYSSEUS:]
Deal

[AEOLUS:]
Take a look right here at this bag
It has the winds of the storm all trapped
All you gotta do is not open this bag

[ODYSSEUS:]
Sounds too easy, what's the catch?

[AEOLUS:]
Ha ha ha
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
If they wanna get the bag open, you gotta say "No, sir"
Sometimes killing is a must

[ODYSSEUS:]
What?

[AEOLUS:]
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Friends turn to foes and rivalries, so
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
(Never really know who you can trust)

[PERIMEDES:]
Captain, what's happening?

[PERIMEDES & ELPENOR:]
What's trapped in that bag?

[ODYSSEUS:]
Something dangerous, friends
We mustn't lag

[WINIONS:]
It's treasure!

[ODYSSEUS:]
What?

[WINIONS:]
Buh-bye!

[PERIMEDES:]
Open the bag

[ELPENOR:]
Let's see what you got

[ODYSSEUS:]
No, do not
Everybody listen closely
See how this bag is closed?
That's how it's supposed to be
This bag has the storm inside
We cannot let the treasure rumour fly

[PERIMEDES & ELPENOR:]
We'll try

[AEOLUS:]
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Now they wanna get the bag open so they can have closure
Sometimes sneaking is a must
Sometimes sneaking is a must

'Cause the end always justifies the means
Everything's changed since Polites, so
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust

[ODYSSEUS:]
For nine days, I've stayed wide awake
Trying to make it home with no storm or tidal wave
I remain unopposed, the bag is still closed
And I'm getting closer to you

[CREW:]
Penelope

[ODYSSEUS:]
I can't wait to make some new memories

[CREW:]
Telemachus

[ODYSSEUS:]
Time for me to be the father I never was

[PENELOPE & TELEMACHUS:]
Just keep your eyes open

[ODYSSEUS:]
Why are my eyes and my heart and my soul so heavy?

[PENELOPE & TELEMACHUS:]
Just keep your eyes open

[ODYSSEUS:]
I keep on trying to embrace you both
Why won't you let me?

[PENELOPE & TELEMACHUS:]
Just keep your eyes open

[ODYSSEUS:]
So much has changed but I'm the same
Yes. I'm the same

[PENELOPE & TELEMACHUS:]
Just keep your eyes open

[ENSEMBLE:]
Keep your eyes open

[PENELOPE:]
Wake up!
Wake up, Odysseus, they're opening the bag
Wake up!

[ODYSSEUS:]
No!

[AEOLUS, {CREW, WINIONS}:]
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
{Never really know who you can trust}
{Never really know who you can trust}
Storm
Full speed ahead

[ODYSSEUS:]
Where's the storm taking us?

[AEOLUS:]
I said to keep the bag closed, but you weren't compliant
If I had to guess? You're headed to the

[AEOLUS & WINIONS:]
Land of the giants

[CREW:]
Storm, storm

[ODYSSEUS:]
Help me close the bag

[EURYLOCHUS:]
But, sir, it's too late

[ODYSSEUS:]
We can save whatever wind is left to use another day
Come on!

[POSEIDON:]
Odysseus of Ithaca
Do you know who I am?
