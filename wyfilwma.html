          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <pre>
[ODYSSEUS:]
Penelope

[PENELOPE:]
Is it you? Have my prayers been answered?
Is it really you standing there?
Or am I dreaming once more?
You look different
Your eyes look tired
Your frame is lighter
You smile torn
Is it really you, my love?

[ODYSSEUS:]
I am not the man you fell in love with
I am not the man you once adored
I am not your kind and gentle husband
And I am not the love you knew before

Would you fall in love with me again
If you knew all I've done?
The things I cannot change
Would you love me all the same?
I know that you've been waiting
Waiting, for love

[PENELOPE:]
What kinds of things did you do?

[ODYSSEUS:]
Left a trail of red on every island
As I traded friends like objects I could use
Hurt more lives than I can count on my hands
But all of that was to bring me back to you
So tell me

Would you fall in love with me again
If you knew all I've done?
The things I can't undo
I'm not the man you knew
I know that you've been waiting, waiting

[PENELOPE:]
If that's true, could you do me a favor?
Just a moment of labor, that could bring me some peace?
See that wedding bed?
Could you carry it over?
Lift it high on your shoulders
And take it far away from here?

[ODYSSEUS:]
How could you say this?
I had built that wedding bed with my blood and sweat
Carved it into the olive tree where we first met
The symbol of our love everlasting
Do you realize what you have asked me?
The only way to move it is to cut it from its roots

[PENELOPE:]
Only my husband knew that
So I guess that makes him you!

[ODYSSEUS:]
Penelope

[PENELOPE:]
I will fall in love with you
Over and over again
I don't care how, where, or when
No matter how long it's been
You're mine
Don't tell me you're not the same person
You're always my husband
And I've been waiting, waiting

[ODYSSEUS:]
Penelope!

[PENELOPE (ODYSSEUS):]
Waiting, waiting (Penelope)
Waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, oh
For you

[PENELOPE:]
How long has it been?

[ODYSSEUS:]
Twenty years

[PENELOPE (PENELOPE & ODYSSEUS):]
I, (I love you)
