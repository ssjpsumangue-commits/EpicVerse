          <pre>
[TELEMACHUS:]
It's just me, myself, and I
Stuck in my bedroom, living in this world you left behind
Dreaming of all these monsters that I'll never get to fight
But boy, I wish I could, so I could bring the world some light

Cause I'm stuck with your stories
But no clue who you are
And no idea if you're dead or just too far
Somebody tell me, come and give me a sign
If I fight those monsters, is it you I'll find?
If so, then

Give me sirens and a cyclops
Give me giants and a hydra
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary
I'll fight the harpies and chimeras
The Minotaur, even Cerberus
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be l-l-l-l-legendary

There are strangers in our halls
Trying to win the heart of my mom
But she is standing tall
108 old faces of men who call me small
They keep taking space and it's not much longer we can stall

Cause they're getting impatient, dangerous too
And I would fight them if I was half as strong as you
Somebody help me, come and give me the strength
Can I do whatever it takes to keep my mom safe?
If so, then

Give me sirens and a cyclops
Give me giants and a hydra
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary
I'll fight the harpies and chimeras
The Minotaur, even Cerberus
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary

[SUITORS:]
Where is he?
Where is the man who'll have you to wife? Oh
Where is he? Where is the man with whom you'll spend your life?
Cause it's been 20 years

[TELEMACHUS:]
20 years

[SUITORS:]
And we still have no king

[TELEMACHUS:]
Give me a chance, a single opportunity and
I'll overcome these obstacles and scrutiny and

[ANTINOUS:]
Boy
When's your tramp of a mother gonna choose a new husband?

[SUITORS:]
Oh

[ANTINOUS:]
Why don't you open her room so we can have fun with her?

[TELEMACHUS:]
Don't you dare call my mother a tramp

[SUITORS:]
Oh

[ANTINOUS:]
I just did
Whatchu gonna do about it, champ?

[TELEMACHUS:]
Somebody tell me
Come and give me a sign
If I fight this monster
Is it you I'll find?
